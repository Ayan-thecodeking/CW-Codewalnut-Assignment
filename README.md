## Setup Instructions :

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayan-thecodeking/CW-Codewalnut-Assignment.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We are using `pnpm` for package management. If you haven't installed `pnpm` yet, you can install it globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Once you have `pnpm` installed, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Available Styling Options

The project is set up with **Tailwind CSS** as the default styling solution. However, you can opt to use any of the following:

- **Tailwind (default)**: Already configured in `src/app/globals.css`.
- **CSS**: You can create and use custom CSS styles by modifying or adding to `src/app/globals.css`.
- **Sass**: A basic Sass configuration is already in place. Add your styles to `src/styles/globals.scss`.

You are free to use any styling approach you prefer, these are just the options set up for you already in this project.

### 4. Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will launch the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
